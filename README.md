# Project in Data Science – Volunteer Platform Visualization

This repository contains:

## Project_POC folder (Core project)

- `main.py`  
  The main Dash / Plotly application for visualizing and comparing volunteer platforms.

- `volunteer_data.xlsx`  
  The Excel workbook with all platform and feature data  
  (sheets: `Platforms`, `Features`, `PlatformFeatures`).

> These two files together form the **final project deliverable**.

## Additional Python files

There are several other `.py` files in the folder.  
These are earlier prototypes, experiments, or concept versions that were used during development,  
but are **not part of the final application**.

## `files` folder

The `files` directory contains:

- different document versions (requirements, descriptions, etc.),
- and a few screenshots taken during development.

These documents were **required for the course** and document the project’s evolution.
